									 The "Play" button allows you to compare the quality of three machine translation engines: our own,

										Tilde's
										</span>
										</a>
										and
										<a href="http://translate.google.com">
										<span class="general-info">
										Google's</span></a>, without knowing which translation was done by which system. After you pick the best translation you will see, which system generated it. That way it's fun, and it also works as unbiased feedback about the translation quality, so we save every click. See the accumulated
